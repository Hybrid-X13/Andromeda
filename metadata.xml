[h1][b]Andromeda[/b][/h1]
Reach for the stars as Andromeda, a new character that [i]revolves[/i] around Planetariums. Normally, Planetariums are rare and not usually worth skipping treasure rooms for, but Andromeda makes them much more worthwhile and easier to get. You’ll almost always be able find at least one during a run, sometimes even two or three.

Andromeda starts with a new item called Gravity Shift, which can stop all tears and projectiles in midair, making them fall down after some time. It’s also Andromeda’s ticket to more Planetariums. All you need to do is [i]shift[/i] reality in the right place.
